# My_Python_Project

## 👋 About Me

Hi! My name is Yeshta.  
I'm passionate about coding and learning new technologies, especially in Python.  
I enjoy building projects, experimenting with code, and sharing what I learn with others.  
Feel free to explore my work, suggest improvements, or connect with me!

## 📄 About This File

This README provides an overview of my project and instructions for installing and running it.  
I created this file to help users easily set up and understand my work.

## 🗂️ Projects Included

1. **01_rock_paper_scissors.py**  
   A simple Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  
   **How to play:**  
   - Choose either rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.  
   - The computer will also make a choice.  
   - Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.  
   - The winner is displayed after each round.

2. **02_Blackjack_deck_game.py**  
   A basic card game simulator in Python.  
   **How to play:**  
   - The deck is shuffled automatically.  
   - You can deal a specified number of cards from the deck.  
   - Each card consists of a suit (Spades, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds) and a rank (A, 2–10, J, Q, K).  
   - The dealt cards are displayed to the player.  
   - You can modify the code to play different card games or deal more cards.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- **random**: Used for shuffling the deck and making random choices for the computer in both games.
- **argparse** (if used in your scripts): For parsing command-line arguments (optional).

All libraries used are part of Python’s standard library, so no extra installation is required.

This project is compatible with **Python 3.8** or higher.  
You can check your Python version with:
```bash
